This GitHub App syncs repository settings defined in `.github/settings.yml` to GitHub, enabling Pull Requests for repository settings.

## Usage

1. __[Install the app](https://github.com/apps/settings)__.
1. Create a `.github/settings.yml` file in your repository. Changes to this file on the default branch will be synced to GitHub.

All top-level settings are optional. Some plugins do have required fields.

```yaml
# These settings are synced to GitHub by https://probot.github.io/apps/settings/

repository:
  # See https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#update-a-repository for all available settings.

  # The name of the repository. Changing this will rename the repository
  name: repo-name

  # A short description of the repository that will show up on GitHub
  description: description of repo

  # A URL with more information about the repository
  homepage: https://example.github.io/

  # A comma-separated list of topics to set on the repository
  topics: github, probot

  # Either `true` to make the repository private, or `false` to make it public.
  private: false

  # Either `true` to enable issues for this repository, `false` to disable them.
  has_issues: true

  # Either `true` to enable projects for this repository, or `false` to disable them.
  # If projects are disabled for the organization, passing `true` will cause an API error.
  has_projects: true

  # Either `true` to enable the wiki for this repository, `false` to disable it.
  has_wiki: true

  # Either `true` to enable downloads for this repository, `false` to disable them.
  has_downloads: true

  # Updates the default branch for this repository.
  default_branch: master

  # Either `true` to allow squash-merging pull requests, or `false` to prevent
  # squash-merging.
  allow_squash_merge: true

  # Either `true` to allow merging pull requests with a merge commit, or `false`
  # to prevent merging pull requests with merge commits.
  allow_merge_commit: true

  # Either `true` to allow rebase-merging pull requests, or `false` to prevent
  # rebase-merging.
  allow_rebase_merge: true

  # Either `true` to enable automatic deletion of branches on merge, or `false` to disable
  delete_branch_on_merge: true

  # Either `true` to enable automated security fixes, or `false` to disable
  # automated security fixes.
  enable_automated_security_fixes: true

  # Either `true` to enable vulnerability alerts, or `false` to disable
  # vulnerability alerts.
  enable_vulnerability_alerts: true

# Labels: define labels for Issues and Pull Requests
labels:
  - name: bug
    color: CC0000
    description: An issue with the system üêõ.

  - name: feature
    # If including a `#`, make sure to wrap it with quotes!
    color: '#336699'
    description: New functionality.

  - name: Help Wanted
    # Provide a new name to rename an existing label
    new_name: first-timers-only

# Milestones: define milestones for Issues and Pull Requests
milestones:
  - title: milestone-title
    description: milestone-description
    # The state of the milestone. Either `open` or `closed`
    state: open

# Collaborators: give specific users access to this repository.
# See https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#add-a-repository-collaborator for available options
collaborators:
  # - username: bkeepers
  #   permission: push
  # - username: hubot
  #   permission: pull

  # Note: `permission` is only valid on organization-owned repositories.
  # The permission to grant the collaborator. Can be one of:
  # * `pull` - can pull, but not push to or administer this repository.
  # * `push` - can pull and push, but not administer this repository.
  # * `admin` - can pull, push and administer this repository.
  # * `maintain` - Recommended for project managers who need to manage the repository without access to sensitive or destructive actions.
  # * `triage` - Recommended for contributors who need to proactively manage issues and pull requests without write access.

# See https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/environments#create-or-update-an-environment for available options
# Note: deployment_branch_policy differs from the API for ease of use. Either protected_branches (boolean) OR custom_branches (array of strings) can be provided; this will manage the API requirements under the hood. See https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/branch-policies for documentation of custom_branches. If both are provided in an unexpected manner, protected_branches will be used.
# Either removing or simply not setting deployment_branch_policy will restore the default 'All branches' setting.

          users: []
          teams: []
      # Required. Require status checks to pass before merging. Set to null to disable
      required_status_checks:
        # Required. Require branches to be up to date before merging.
        strict: true
        # Required. The list of status checks to require in order to merge into this branch
        contexts: []
      # Required. Enforce all configured restrictions for administrators. Set to true to enforce required status checks for repository administrators. Set to null to disable.
      enforce_admins: true
      # Prevent merge commits from being pushed to matching branches
      required_linear_history: true
      # Required. Restrict who can push to this branch. Team and user restrictions are only available for organization-owned repositories. Set to null to disable.

        teams: []
```

### Notes

1. Label color can also start with `#`, e.g. `color: '#F341B2'`. Make sure to wrap it with quotes!
1. Each top-level element under branch protection must be filled (eg: `required_pull_request_reviews`, `required_status_checks`, `enforce_admins` and `restrictions`). If you don't want to use one of them you must set it to `null` (see comments in the example above). Otherwise, none of the settings will be applied.

### Inheritance

This app is built with [probot](https://github.com/probot/probot), and thus uses the [octokit-plugin-config](https://github.com/probot/octokit-plugin-config). This means you can inherit settings from another repo, and only override what you want to change.

Individual settings in the arrays listed under `labels`, `teams` (once it is supported) and `branches` will be merged with the base repo if the `name` of an element in the array matches the `name` of an element in the corresponding array in the base repo. A possible future enhancement would be to make that work for the other settings arrays based on `username`, or `title`. This is not currently supported.

To further clarify: Inheritance within the Protected Branches plugin allows you to override specific settings per branch. For example, your `.github` repo may set default protection on the `master` branch. You can then include `master` in your `branches` array, and only override the `required_approving_review_count`.
Alternatively, you might only have a branch like `develop` in your `branches` array, and would still get `master` protection from your base repo.

## Security Implications

__WARNING:__ Note that this app inherently _escalates anyone with `push` permissions to the __admin__ role_, since they can push config settings to the `master` branch, which will be synced. In a future, we may add restrictions to allow changes to the config file to be merged only by specific people/teams, or those with __admin__ access _(via a combination of protected branches, required statuses, and branch restrictions)_. Until then, use caution when merging PRs and adding collaborators.

Until restrictions are added in this app, one way to preserve admin/push permissions is to utilize the [GitHub CodeOwners feature](https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/) to set one or more administrative users as the code owner of the `.github/settings.yml` file, and turn on "require code owner review" for the master branch. This does have the side effect of requiring code owner review for the entire branch, but helps preserve permission levels.
